I am an Advanced Computer Science M.Phil candidate at Cambridge University in Churchill College, advised by [Prof. Richard Mortier](https://mort.io/) and [Prof. Srinivasan Keshav](https://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). I am interested in AI for climate change, distributed IoT systems, federated learning, and sustainable computing.<br>

Before Cambridge, I researched green computing and lossy compression in high-performance computing (HPC) with [Prof. Jon Calhoun](https://jonccal.people.clemson.edu/) at Clemson University, developed novel lossy compression techniques for federated learning at [Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov/) advised by [Dr. Sheng Di](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~shdi/),and designed IoT software for smart grid applications at [Tesla, Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/powerwall/own/california-virtual-power-plant).
