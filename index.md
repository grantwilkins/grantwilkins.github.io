Hey! I am originally from Kingsport, TN and am currently Electrical Engineering PhD Student at Stanford University. I am working with [Ram Rajagopal](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ram-rajagopal) on making a responsive electric grid with respect to data centers and their boom in power usage fueled by AI. I am broadly interested in using computing as a tool to mitigate the effects of climate change. Due to the many ways we cause and experience climate change this can take many forms. Some specific examples in my work are being energy conscious in datacenters, applying real-time sensing to energy systems, or attempting to learn patterns and behaviors in microgrids. <br>

A few things I have been a part of: 
- Energy-optimizing serving and routing of LLM inference systems supervised by [Prof. Richard Mortier](https://mort.io/) and [Prof. Srinivasan Keshav](https://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) at the University of Cambridge.
- Modeling high-performance computing energy consumption supervised by [Prof. Jon Calhoun](https://jonccal.people.clemson.edu/) at Clemson University.
- Developing lossy compression techniques for federated learning supervised by [Dr. Sheng Di](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~shdi/) at [Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov/).
- Designing IoT software for smart grid applications at [Tesla, Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/powerwall/own/california-virtual-power-plant).
