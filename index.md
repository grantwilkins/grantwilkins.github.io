I am an Advanced Computer Science M.Phil candidate at Cambridge University in Churchill College, advised by [Prof. Richard Mortier](https://mort.io/) and [Prof. Srinivasan Keshav](https://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). I am broadly interested in using computing as a tool to mitigate the effects of climate change. Due to the many ways we cause and experience climate change this can take many forms. Some specific examples in my work are being energy conscious in datacenters, applying real-time sensing to energy systems, or attempting to learn patterns and behaviors in microgrids. I am an incoming Electrical Engineering PhD student at Stanford University where I intend to work with [Ram Rajagopal](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ram-rajagopal) on applying federated learning for secure energy systems. <br>

A few things I have been a part of: I researched green computing and lossy compression in high-performance computing (HPC) with [Prof. Jon Calhoun](https://jonccal.people.clemson.edu/) at Clemson University, developed lossy compression techniques for federated learning at [Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov/) advised by [Dr. Sheng Di](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~shdi/), and designed IoT software for smart grid applications at [Tesla, Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/powerwall/own/california-virtual-power-plant).
