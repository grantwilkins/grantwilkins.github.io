I am an Advanced Computer Science MPhil candidate at Cambridge University in Churchill College, advised by [Prof. Richard Mortier](https://mort.io/). I am interested in AI for climate change, distributed IoT systems, federated learning, and sustainable computing.<br>

Before Cambridge, I researched green computing and lossy compression in high-performance computing (HPC) with [Prof. Jon Calhoun](https://jonccal.people.clemson.edu/) at Clemson University, developed novel lossy compressors for edge and IoT devices at [Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov/) advised by [Dr. Sheng Di](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~shdi/),and designed IoT software for smart grid applications at [Tesla, Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/powerwall/own/california-virtual-power-plant).
