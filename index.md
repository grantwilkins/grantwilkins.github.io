Hey! I am Grant Wilkins, an Electrical Engineering PhD student at Stanford University from Kingsport, TN. I am currently exploring the relationship between the electric grid operation and planning and data center power infrastructure, in part due to their boom in power usage fueled by AI. 

I am interested in ways we can use compute as a tool to complement energy systems towards a more sustainable future and to combat effects of climate change. Due to the many ways we cause and experience climate change this kind of work takes many forms. Some specific examples in my work are being energy conscious in datacenters, applying real-time sensing to energy systems, or attempting to learn patterns and behaviors in microgrids. <br>

A few things I am or have been a part of: 
- Mitigating transients and load swings in AI training clusters at Stanford University
- Designing next-generation data center power hierarchies to reduce overbuilding [Microsoft Azure Research--Systems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-research-systems/)
- Energy-optimizing serving and routing of LLM inference systems supervised by [Richard Mortier](https://mort.io/) and [Srinivasan Keshav](https://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) at the University of Cambridge.
- Modeling high-performance computing energy consumption supervised by [Jon Calhoun](https://jonccal.people.clemson.edu/) at Clemson University.
- Developing lossy compression techniques for federated learning supervised by [Sheng Di](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~shdi/) at [Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov/).
- Designing IoT software for smart grid applications at [Tesla, Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/powerwall/own/california-virtual-power-plant).
